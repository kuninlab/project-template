## Credits

This is forked from Patrick Mineault's [`true-neutral-cookiecutter`](https://github.com/patrickmineault/true-neutral-cookiecutter).
Minor updates have been made to bring the "packaging" up to modern standards (or at least, a modern standard).
You should be able to use this cookiecutter in the same way, as described in his guide to research programming, [The Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/).
